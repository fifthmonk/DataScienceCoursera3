### Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

How to run the script
===========

In run_analysis.R, you need to replace the variable my_home_path to where the Samsung data directory "UCI HAR Dataset" is located. The script run_analysis.R should also be located inside the Samsung data directory

## Dataset Directory Structure
* run_analysis.R
* activity_labels.txt
* features_info.txt
* features.txt
* README.txt
* test
* train


1. set current directory to where run_analysis.R is located
2. run R command: source("run_analysis.R")
3. tidy data would be written to file tidy_data.txt at directory of what defined in variable my_home_path

Thank you.
